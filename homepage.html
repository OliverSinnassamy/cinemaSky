            <p>The pain itself is very important, and the growth of the patient will be followed, 
                but at the same time they occur as a great deal of pain and suffering. 
                For to come to the smallest detail, no one should practice any kind of work unless 
                he derives some benefit from it. Do not be angry with the pain in the reprimand in 
                the pleasure he wants to be a hair from the pain in the hope that there is no breeding. 
                Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not come forth; they are in fault who abandon their 
                duties it softens the soul, that is, the sufferings. But in order that you may see whence all
                 this born error of those who accuse pleasure and praise pain, I will open the whole matter, and
                  I will atone for the very things which were said by that discoverer of truth and as it were the 
                  architect of a happy life. For no one despises or hates or runs away from pleasure because it is 
                  pleasure, but because great pains result to those who do not know how to follow pleasure with reason.
